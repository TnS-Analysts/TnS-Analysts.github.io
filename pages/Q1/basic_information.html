            <h1>Definition of Streaming</h1>
            <p>Streaming is a type of media that is delivered and consumed in a continuous manner from a source. It’s a process of transmitting or receiving data, especially video and audio material over a computer network as a steady, continuous flow, allowing playback to start while the rest of the data is still being received.</p>

            <h2>How Does Streaming Work?</h2>
            <p>It works by breaking down the data packets that constitute the video or audio data and interpreting each play as a video or audio in the player on the user’s device. Streaming allows users to view such content continuously and enjoy a seamless viewing. Instead of the entire media file being downloaded first, the content is transmitted in data packets a few seconds at a time and stored on the user’s device to be played there remotely.</p>
