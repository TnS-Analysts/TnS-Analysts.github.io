          <p>This year, APEC Schools Ortigas Extension has decided to have one IPBA output for English and Lifelabs for Grade 10 students in Quarter 1. They had assigned us to create a research topic and start with the  first chapter of our research paper for the English portion. In terms of the LifeLabs component, they had assigned us the task of selecting a streaming content type that we will use in documenting the findings of our research paper; in order to do so, we needed to conduct a viewer analysis on our chosen streaming category. We were also tasked to determine the needs of our viewers. The following is the step-by-step process of choosing a streaming content type and determining  the needs of our viewers.</p>

            <h1>Step 1: Preparing our Research Topic</h1>
            <p>Before we could begin the Lifelabs portion of our IPBA, we had to finish parts 2 and 3 of the IPBA, which covered the English sections, where we had to choose a research topic and write a research title, thesis statement, and research questions. We needed to prioritize these parts first because we were not allowed to begin our Lifelabs PBA without them because they were critical in answering the Lifelabs questions.</p>

        <h1>Step 2: Choosing our Content Types</h1>
        <p>We used basic research to gather common streaming content types that we could possibly use in documenting our research, we discussed our options and the pros and cons of each content . After much deliberation we had narrowed down our options to three content types that we found most appropriate and beneficial for our research topic. The three content types we chose are:</p>

          <div class="column">
            <img src="../images/educational.png"/>
            <strong>Educational Videos</strong>
            <i>These are videos whose primary purpose is to provide academic information and knowledge to the viewers about a topic.</i>
          </div>

          <div class="column">
            <img src="../images/audio.png"/>
            <strong>Audio Podcasts</strong>
            <i>These are audio streams composed of spoken words which discuss a certain topic.</i>

          <div class="column">

            <strong>Interviews</strong>
            <i>These are videos or audio streams in which the host/interviewer asks structured questions to another person/interviewee.</i>

        <h1>Step 3: Viewer Analysis for Each Streaming Category</h1>
        <p>After choosing our three content types, we created a survey which analyzed the following information from participants:</p>

        <br><p>The said survey was then distributed on September 20 among APEC Schools Cluster A students, and it received a total of 87 responses. The survey results arranged based on preferred streaming content type/category are shown below:</p>

            <h1>Step 4: Choosing our final streaming category and platform</h1>
            <p>Our final content type is <strong>Educational Videos</strong>, which will be uploaded to <strong>YouTube</strong>. This decision was made based on the results of our survey, in which the majority of participants thought Educational Videos would be the best streaming content type for our topic, receiving 65.5% of the votes from the 87 respondents. As for the streaming platform, survey results shows that 85.5% of the respondents answered that YouTube is the streaming platform they used the most.</p>

        <h1>Step: 5: Finding the needs of our Viewers</h1>
          <p>To find out what our viewers needed, we had to first empathize with them. To accomplish this, we used the empathizing methods of <strong>Asking the 5 Whys</strong> and <strong>What-How-Why</strong> on the problem that we are attempting to address, which is that students in the online setting are prone to periods of unproductivity and demotivation, which is detrimental to their learning and academic progress. These methods enabled us to discard our assumptions about the viewer's needs and gain insight into what they truly needed.</p>

          //PICTURE OF METHODS USED//

          <p>After completing the empathizing methods, we were able to establish the needs of our viewers based on the root cause of the problem, which was that students are unaware of alternative strategies and coping mechanisms for dealing with unproductivity and demotivation. After determining the root cause, we discovered a possible solution for the root cause of their problem in our English research paper, which is to establish a link between listening to music music and increased productivity as an alternative strategy for productivity and motivation booster. Thus, in order to meet the needs of our viewers, we listed reasons why they should be aware of and informed about what we were attempting to study.</p>
