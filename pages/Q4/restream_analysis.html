This was a significant improvement from the level of engagement in the previous stream, which was 156, and this can be primarily attributed to the changes made in the second stream.

In addition, all (100%) of the respondents in the streaming feedback evaluation form found the streamers’ ability to engage them to be “excellent,” reflecting the relatively high engagement of the stream.</p>
