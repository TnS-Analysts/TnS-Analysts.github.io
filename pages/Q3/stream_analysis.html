        <h1>Section I: Summary of the Stream</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>T&S Analysts launched their first ever livestream titled "The Grasp of Music" on Saturday, February 4, 2023 at 2:00 pm. The stream was hosted by the entire team. The hosts were presented in a Google Meet session with both their cameras and microphones open. Each host was displayed in the stream alongside the slideshow. In the stream itself, the streamers shared what they have found in their research paper from the English subject titled “The Efficacy of Studying Without Music in Comparison to Studying with Music in Increasing Productivity among Grade 10 Students of APEC Schools Ortigas Extension.” Before formally starting the discussion, the host Vincent William Rodriguez asked questions about their listening habits and experiences through the comment section. Afterwards, the hosts discussed each section of their research paper so far, beginning with the background of the study as discussed by Grace Angela Victorio and Hillarey Bazar, in which the hosts explained the underlying reason for conducting their research and why the team had chosen “The Effects of Music on Productivity” as their topic. This is followed by the statement of the problem led by Cayril Aguilar where he discussed the purpose of the research and the research questions. Subsequently, the host Ryza Eireene Uy discussed the significance of their study, explaining the relevance of the research to students, parents, educators and future researchers. After this, Vincent then proceeds to discuss the review of related literature while ensuring that all points were made and summarized for the viewers’ benefit. Finally, the hosts played a pre-recorded interview with Ryza interviewing the guest interviewee about their habit of listening to music while studying and how it has helped her throughout the years, giving the viewers a preview of the experimental research's possible findings.</p>
        
        <p>There were several aspects of both the planning and execution of the stream that were done effectively by the streamers, including but not limited to the amiable attitude of the hosts, the active participation of the audience with the streamers, and as well as the stream’s  schedule, accuracy, content, usability, and overall quality according to the viewers. On the other hand, the steam has had areas that need a considerable amount of improvement, such as the recurrent periods of dead air, improper speaking rate of the hosts, and the disruptive technical difficulties encountered in the streaming session. In addition, the stream was able to attain a relatively high level of engagement since being published, thereby improving its overall performance. Nonetheless, the stream’s viewership did somewhat poorly in terms of video views and average minutes viewed; this can likely be attributed to factors such as the lack of incentives, substandard audio quality of the hosts, and the time-consuming discussion of the topic.</p>

        <p>The analysis revealed that many aspects of the stream were well done; however, there were some areas where they could strive to improve. In this regard, the streamers should strive to improve their technical preparation, ensuring that their audio is audible throughout the stream to guarantee that no technical difficulties would arise in the middle of the stream. Additionally, in order to avoid dead airs and further engage the audience, streamers should avoid being stiff and rigid in their manner of speaking while hosting. To further increase the stream’s viewership, the streamers should also consider using incentives (e.g., raffles) for the audience to watch and stay longer on the stream, while also making the stream discussion less mundane and more exciting.</p>
      </div></div>
      
      <div class="background section-2"><div class="content hidden">
        <h1>Section II: Successful Aspects of the Stream</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>To begin, the streamers believe that the schedule in which the stream was held was well thought out. The stream took place on Saturday, February 4, 2023 at 2 p.m. From the streamers’ standpoint, this schedule was beneficial for viewership as streaming on the weekends allowed them to invoke more viewers, most of which had no classes. As a consequence, this increased the likelihood of them being on their phones to be notified of the ongoing live stream.</p>

        <p>In the stream itself, the streamers maintain that the portrayed attitude of the hosts was well executed. Throughout the stream, the hosts portrayed a jovial attitude as they started with a joyful and comedic introduction of themselves, expressing to the viewers that despite the formal topic and content of the stream, they will still enjoy watching while learning at the same time. This resulted in a familiar atmosphere between the audience and the streamers, allowing the streamers to control the conversation to avoid many noticeable dead airs.</p>

          <img src="/images/stream_analysis/figure1.png">
          <figcaption>Figure 1: Ratings of Streamers’ Ability to Engage Viewers</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Figure 1 references the feedback form answered by the audience, in which 56.3% of viewers rated the streamers’ ability to engage them ‘good’ while 43.8% rated ‘excellent’. Indeed, the streamers made efforts to engage the audience with questions about their experiences in achieving tasks while listening to music, including live polls in the comment section. The goal of engaging the audience was quite successful, in accordance with comments such as “love u guys !!! had fun watching ur stream“, “HI GUYS! I LOVE UR STREAM“, and “thank u guysssssssss so good ng streaaam!!“.</p>

          <figcaption>Figure 2: Viewer’s Rating of Accuracy of Stream to Stream Outline</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>To ensure that the stream runs smoothly for both the audience and hosts, the streamers acted in accordance with the streaming outline made last quarter. This is verified by Figure 2 which shows that 50% of the viewers rated the accuracy of the streaming outline compared to the streaming session as ‘excellent’ while the other 43.8% rated it ‘very good’.</p>

          <figcaption>Figure 3: Viewer’s Rating  of the Duration of The Stream</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>In order to lessen the time consumption of the discussion portion of the stream, the team shortened the research paper serving as the basis of the stream content. This proved to be fruitful for the team as according to Figure 3, 43.8% of the viewers rated that duration of the stream as ‘good’ and 56.3% rated the duration as ‘excellent’.</p>

          <figcaption>Figure 4: Viewer’s Streaming Content Relevance Evaluation</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Based on Figure 4, the viewers found the content to be relevant as established by feedback form wherein 93.8% of the viewers found the streaming content relevant to address solutions, issues or challenges in their lives. The content went fairly well in terms of organization and the information included as the streamers kept most essential points of the research while shortening the research paper for the stream discussion, keeping in mind the goal of enlightening their viewers of using music as a productivity booster.</p>

        <figure>

          <figcaption>Figure 5: Viewer’s Usage of Streaming Content</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Furthermore, the viewers were asked about the utility of the stream information. 81.3% said that they could immediately use the information while 12.5% said that they could use it 7 to 12 months from now, and 6.3% said that they could use it 2 to 6 months from now.</p>

          <figcaption>Figure 7: Viewer’s Expectations In Comparison to the Streaming Session</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>Moreover, the streamers have received feedback regarding the expectations of the audience in relation to the stream itself. The teaser video intended to advertise the then-upcoming stream gave the audience a preview of what to expect. This created expectations that, based on Figure 7, have been met. 56.3% of the viewers said that the expectations were met excellently, 37.5% say that expectations were met very well, and 6.5% said that expectations were met well.</p>

        <p>Figure 8 states that 56.3% rated the overall streaming session as ‘excellent’, 37.5% rated ‘very good’ and 6.3% rated the streaming session as ‘good’, and thus, the viewers’ aforementioned evaluation and feedback point to the stream being successful. Certainly, the resulting analytics of the stream was the result of the team’s hard work and time; the team meticulously planned their content and script to guarantee that all goals of the stream had been reached and properly delivered.  They had diligently prepared for the execution of the stream to ensure the smooth flow and optimal audience experience for their viewers.</p>

      <div class="background section-3"><div class="content hidden">
        <h1>Section III: Areas of Opportunities for the Stream</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>There are several major areas of opportunity in the stream, all of which demand careful consideration in the subsequent stream. One of these is the occasional dead air all throughout the whole stream discussion, as pointed out by a respondent from the streaming feedback evaluation form. There were various instances, especially during recitations, in which the viewers did not immediately comment on their answers, leading to protracted periods of silence. These absences of communication caused the viewers’ level of excitement and engagement to gradually decrease, prompting some to stop watching the stream. Thus, the streamers must discover potential strategies to minimize dead air to the greatest extent, so as to allow the stream to flow smoothly and prevent boredom and confusion among the audience.</p>

        <p>Another area of improvement in the stream is the hosts’ manner of speaking during the stream discussion. Indeed, a viewer suggested in the form that the hosts should relax more, as there were several moments in which they had talked too quickly for the audience to comprehend the discussion clearly. On the other hand, another viewer recommended that the hosts should raise their level of energy and enthusiasm so as to encourage more viewers to watch the stream. It can also be said that the stream became largely nonspontaneous since a large majority of the stream discussion was read off a script, though there were a few times wherein the hosts used impromptu. Consequently, the hosts must consider slowing down the tempo of their speech, becoming more enthusiastic, and relying less on scripted dialogues in order to make the audience more connected to the streamers and the stream’s topic.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, addressing the significant technical issues that have occurred during the steaming session is also exigent. First, the streamers had to immediately restream after failing to properly do so in the first attempt due to technical difficulties, likely causing discontentment and frustration among the audience as indicated by the form’s responses. Not long after, there were some instances wherein the audio of the hosts’ microphone was quite unintelligible which confused several viewers. Last but not least, only the audio of the pre-recorded guest interview was able to be shown; the streamers originally intended to show both audio and video. Therefore, the streamers must spend more time preparing for the subsequent stream with regards to the technical aspects of the stream, so as to foresee any possible technical problems and take measures to prevent them from happening again.</p>

        <h1>Section IV: Level of Engagement of the Stream</h1>
        <figure>
          <img src="/images/stream_analysis/figure9.png">
          <figcaption>Figure 9: Reach and Engagements of the Streaming Session</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Based on Figure 9, there were a total of 156 total engagements which include 58 reactions, 89 comments, and 9 shares. The relatively high level of engagement among the viewers positively affected the overall performance of the stream as it allowed the stream to remain vigorous as opposed to being too dull, particularly the reactions and the comments. By actively commenting on the stream, the viewers gave the streamers more information and experiences to discuss about, thus improving the quality of the stream in terms of content. This is also supported by the responses in the streaming feedback evaluation form, in which 56.25% of the respondents rated the streamers’ ability to engage them as ‘good’ while 43.75% rated ‘excellent’. Moreover, the 9 shares also helped the stream reach more people and gain more exposure, thereby further increasing viewer engagement.</p>

        <p>There are several reasons that might explain the favorable level of engagement of the stream. Indeed, a large portion of the 89 comments were made by actively participating viewers, whom the streamers kept engaged by occasionally asking them questions about their experiences regarding music listening and holding recitations about unfamiliar terms. Specifically, the streamers asked questions about what music means to them and how it affects their productivity. The responses from the audience was mostly positive, with many saying that the music has been beneficial and made them more productive. The streamer also asked who their favorite artist was and what kind of genre they frequently listen to, eliciting more responses from the viewers. Reading the chats and mentioning the viewers names prompted viewers to answer the streamers given questions. By doing so, the streamers effectively built a rapport with their viewers and established more interactions with them.</p>

          <img src="/images/stream_analysis/figure10.png">
          <figcaption>Figure 10: Viewership During the Stream</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Based on Figure 10, there were a total of 66 <i>3-second views</i> and 36 <i>1-minute views</i> during the stream. In addition, the number of live viewers peaked at 16 viewers. Before the stream was conducted, the streamers originally intended to garner at least 50 viewers but were only able to reach 36 <i>1-minute views</i> by the end of the stream, only passing the goal long after it concluded.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="/images/stream_analysis/figure11.png">
          <figcaption>Figure 11: Viewership Since Stream Was Published</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>According to Figure 11, the stream continued accumulating additional views after it was published, reaching over 179 <i>3-second views</i> and 55 <i>1-minute views</i>. Furthermore, the average minutes viewed are only 6 minutes and 39 seconds during the livestream itself, eventually decreasing into 2 minutes and 15 seconds after the stream was published. In light of the viewership goal of 50 viewers, the stream barely succeeded in reaching the goal, and there are several potential explanations for the relatively low viewership.</p>

        <p>Based on the feedback received from the streaming evaluation form, one of the possible reasons for why was the lack of incentives within the stream. The streamers observed from other groups that the presence of incentives for the viewers to stay longer in the stream would generally lead to an increase in live viewership. Therefore, the streamers should use effective incentives such as raffles for the actively participating viewers, encouraging viewers to watch until the end and leading them into sharing it with others, thus resulting in a greater average minutes watched.</p>

        <p>The audio quality of the stream can also be considered as a factor. During the stream, there were technical issues regarding the audio wherein the volume can be barely heard. There were times in the stream where the viewers could not hear the hosts when they were asking questions. This along with the technical delay due to the limitations of the bandwidth created noticeable dead airs even if the hosts were quick to manipulate the conversation.</p>

        <p>Last but not least is the lengthy discussion of the stream’s topic. Indeed, the average minutes viewed during the streaming session were only 6 minutes and 53 seconds, compared to the total streaming time of 54 minutes and 44 seconds. Although the discussion itself is quite detailed and extensive, the viewers might nevertheless have found it rather wearisome to watch. As a result, many viewers were prompted to leave the stream so as to conserve valuable time, thereby decreasing the number of live viewers. Therefore, in the next stream, the streamers should consider reducing the length of mundane discussion, allowing for more activities and engagement with the viewers.</p>
